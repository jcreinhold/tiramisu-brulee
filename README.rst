A 2D and 3D PyTorch implementation of the Tiramisu CNN

This package is primarily used for multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation; specifically, T2 lesions in the brain.

* Free software: Apache Software License 2.0
* Documentation: https://tiramisu-brulee.readthedocs.io.

Install
-------

The easiest way to install the package is with::

    pip install tiramisu-brulee

Alternatively, you can download the source and run::

    python setup.py install

If you want a CLI to train a lesion segmentation model
(or work with anything in the ``experiment`` subpackage), install with::

    pip install "tiramisu-brulee[lesionseg]"

Basic Usage
-----------

Import the 2D or 3D Tiramisu version with:

.. code-block:: python

    from tiramisu_brulee.model import Tiramisu2d, Tiramisu3d

If you install tiramisu-brulee with ``[lesionseg]`` extras, then you
can train a lesion segmentation Tiramisu CNN and predict with::

    lesion-train ...
    lesion-predict ...
    lesion-predict-image ...

Use the ``--help`` option to see the arguments. See the documentation for a
tutorial on how to use the CLIs.

Why the name?
-------------

Why is the name tiramisù-brûlée? Well, tiramisù is named after the neural network [1] whose name is inspired by
the dessert; however, tiramisu—by itself—was already taken as a package on PyPI. I added brûlée to get around the
existence of that package and because this package is written in PyTorch (torch -> burnt). Plus brûlée in English is
often associated with the dessert crème brûlée. Why combine an Italian word (tiramisù) with a French word (brûlée)?
Because I didn't think about it until after I already deployed the package to PyPI.
